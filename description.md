# DESCRIPTION
\
\
# # Dataset
The dataset has been created using sklearn's make_classification()
\
\
**Number of samples:** 100
\
\
**Number of features:** 20
\
\
**Number of classes:** 2(as it is a binary classification problem)
\
\
# # Model
\
\
We are using **Logistic Regression** and **Linear Regression** as our classifiers.
# # # Working of our app





# # # Interpretation of the graphs
In the Logistic Regression graph as we can clearly see that with the increase in number of iterations, the accuracy score is improving.Forward feature selection and backward feature selection both are converging to almost similar values. But Forward feature selection seems to perform better with increased number of informative fatures selected.
